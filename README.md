gpgToolit
a tool to streamline using gpg.
allows you to: generate keys, list keys and securely encrypt and decrypt messages.

please not that currently this script requires figlet and srm (part of the secure-delete toolkit)

INSTRUCTIONS:
git clone https://github.com/c0w3rt/gpgToolkit
sudo apt install secure-delete figlet
sudo chmod +x gpgToolkit.sh

run the script with sudo permissions, as gpg requires it.
